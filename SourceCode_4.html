		Political parties back launch of new online platform to debate island of Ireland’s future

        A new online resource, launched today by the University of Liverpool’s Institute of Irish Studies with support from parties across the political spectrum, will seek to provide a space for pro-Irish Unity and pro-Union voices to debate the future of the island of Ireland, and the UK.

        Director of the Institute of Irish Studies, Professor Peter Shirlow FAcSS, worked with Civic Space to develop the platform, which features multimedia, comment and discussion from the public – as well as leaders and influencers, including Sinn Féin’s Mary Lou McDonald and Northern Ireland Health Minister, Robin Swann.

        Professor Shirlow said: “This digital platform broadens the debate and shows that within both perspectives there are robust and evidenced arguments for constitutional change or otherwise.

        “It highlights how the Good Friday Agreement shifted society into an acknowledgement of co-dependency in terms of the future, a capacity to debate across the divide and, more importantly, to be heard.

        “This initiative will help frame how debates could and should be conducted through evidence-led approaches and inter-community consultation.”

			Greenland ice loss may have begun as early as the mid-80s

The amount of snow falling on Greenland’s glaciers may have been less than the water lost through icebergs calving and melting since at least the mid-1980s, a study of almost 40 years of satellite images has revealed.

The study was undertaken by Dominik Fahrner, a PhD student with the University of Liverpool’s School of Environmental Sciences, and involved reviewing over 20,000 satellite images of over 200 glaciers, then selecting around 3,800 images for analysis. This analysis showed some glaciers had been losing ice for over a decade longer than previously though.

This is one of the first largescale assessments of such a wide range of glaciers. Previously it was far too time consuming and labour intensive because of the time taken to download, process and analyse them. The study was made possible by cloud computing that cut the time to obtain these images from 20 minutes per image to around 5 seconds.

All the images used had existed ever since they were captured – for many, this was decades ago. However, by taking advantage of cloud computing technology, it is the first time it has been possible to analyse these over such long timescales over the entire ice sheet.
